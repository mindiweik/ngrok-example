# ngrok-example

Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to showcase some of the essential functionality for "live" API endpoint and webhook testing.

### Flow of demo:

1. Begin with a brief code overview.
2. Start the server and head to the basic "/" GET request.

- Take a quick look at `localhost:4040` to see the inspection interface.

3. Stop the server and show scripts for authentication.
4. Run the script for `basic-auth`. Take a look at the terminal to see requests and other details.
5. Run the script for `oauth`. Take a look at the terminal again.
